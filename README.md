GBA.js Modern
======
This is a modernized version of GBA.js, combining the improvements made through [gbajs2](https://github.com/andychase/gbajs2?tab=readme-ov-file), [EmulatorJS](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS), and others, all while keeping the ability to deploy through GitHub pages. **This is a student's project**, and may contian significant errors or extremely slow improvements. Contribs are highly encouraged.

## Game Compatibility
For the gbajs2 engine, a compatability list can be found [here](https://github.com/andychase/gbajs2/wiki/Compatibility-List).
